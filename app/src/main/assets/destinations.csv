6:Kumamoto En Japanese Garden:A gift to San Antonio in 1989 by its sister city, Kumamoto, the Kumamoto En (En means garden in Japanese) is an authentic Japanese Garden designed by landscape artists and craftsmen from Japan. In exchange, San Antonio gave Kumamoto a log cabin from the Hill Country town of Fredericksburg.Designed by the Emperor’s gardener (and corporate CEO) Kiyoshi Yasui, this 85’ x 85’ garden is modeled after one at the Emperor’s summer house — which required special permission. The pond symbolizes the Pacific Ocean that separates the East and West. The west side of the garden honors Mt. Fuji, the center hill Mt. Aso (near Kumamoto), and with its oak trees, the east side of the garden is a nod to the Texas Hill Country. Don’t miss this haven of rustic simplicity and peace featuring more than 30 elements of a classic Japanese garden, including stone walks, unique water elements, granite lanterns, and bamboo fences.

12:Sullivan Carriage House/Restaurant:The Daniel Sullivan Carriage House was built in 1896 for one of the most colorful figures of early Texas, Daniel J. Sullivan. A superb example of the round-arched Richardsonian Romanesque style, the Daniel Sullivan Carriage House is a step back in history so real you can almost hear the wooden wheels and horse hooves. An Irish immigrant, Sullivan served in the Texas Cavalry, 1st Regiment, during the Civil War. In 1882, he founded D. Sullivan & Co. Private Bankers, whose loans made possible the legendary cattle drives of the 19th century. Sullivan commissioned Alfred Giles, an English immigrant who moved to San Antonio in 1873, to design the coach house and stables built behind Sullivan’s home at Fourth and Broadway. Giles not only produced these beautiful, classic structures, but quickly established himself as the region’s most noted architect with many buildings to his credit in Texas and northern Mexico. After Daniel Sullivan’s death, one of his daughters, Mary Elizabeth, and her husband, Major General John Lincoln Clem, resided in the home. Years earlier, in 1861, a nine-year-old Clem attempted to enlist in the Union Army. Rejected because of his youth, he attached himself unofficially to the 22nd Michigan Infantry and participated in the Battle of Shiloh as a drummer, for which he received notoriety as the Drummer Boy of Shiloh. In 1987, the San Antonio Botanical Garden was offered the Carriage House with one stipulation – it must be moved within three months. With major support from the San Antonio Conservation Society that challenging goal was achieved. The Carriage House was completely disassembled by skilled stonemasons who cleaned and marked each limestone block. After a careful move to its new location at the Botanical Garden, the building was painstakingly reassembled stone by stone. In 1995, after several years of careful restoration, this beloved San Antonio historical building was opened and served as the entry to the Botanical Garden until 2019.

26:Palm and Cycad Pavilion:Cycads are relics of the Carboniferous Age (dinosaur times), and this display features the Queen Sago (tallest cycad), Lata Palm, and Coconut Palm. In the tropics, these useful plants provide food, shade, building materials, fuel, and clothing.
27:Fern Grotto:Some of the oldest living plants are found in this exhibit, dating even further back than the Cycads. When ancient ferns died, they became the great coal and oil deposits that today’s world uses to obtain energy.
28:Texas Native Trail Pavilion:A unique aspect of the San Antonio Botanical Garden, the Texas Native Trail gives guests the chance to walk across Texas. The trail features three distinctive and diverse ecological regions of Texas: the Hill Country (Edwards Plateau), East Texas Pineywoods, and South Texas. These three areas vary greatly in soil, topography and weather — which has resulted in the development of very separate plant life communities. The authentic botanical setting is enhanced by several early Texas houses, which have been reconstructed on the site to help illustrate and interpret the regional themes. Hit the trail to enjoy this one-of-a-kind experience.
29:Auld House:Fed by a roof cistern collecting rainwater, a shallow trough in front of the Bird Watch beckons its feathered guests with the sound of dripping water. Just deep enough for wading, the birds can take a long cool sip or linger for a refreshing splash. Native plants complement the setting and were careful complied with consideration for the seasons. Maximilian sunflowers and salvia will attract the lesser goldfinches in summer. In wintertime, berry-producing selections include the Barbados cherry, Turk’s cap, possumhaw and yaupon holly. Another planting is the Texas ebony, a favorite of the Long-billed Thrasher. Other frequent feathered guests include the Painted Bunting, Black chinned Hummingbird, the White-throated Sparrow, the orange-crowned Warbler, Ruby-crowned Kinglet and Purple Martin. Dan Auld, who bequeathed the cabin to the Botanical Garden, recalled the process of building the home, “My father and a group of young Scotchmen cut these piñon logs for this home up on top of one of the hills on the ranch, carried them to the valley, put them on ox carts, and carried them to the present location.” This Auld forebear was killed when he fell from his horse and was dragged to death. His widow, Susanna Lowrance Gibbens Auld, stayed on the remote ranch and raised seven children by herself. The house itself was ideally situated, located on the protected base of a 300-foot cliff where a natural spring and fern bank had formed. Mrs. Auld kept milk, butter, and eggs in a cool niche above the spring. Comanche Indians, who had long used the cliff site as a campground would still come to camp there. On horseback, they would peer down at the Auld Homestead but never bother the widow or her children. In 1996, the daughter of Dan Auld, Joan Auld Powell Hallmark, acted on her late father’s bequest of the homestead to the Botanical Garden. Botanical Garden’s board member, Cecil Jackson, whose avocation was log cabin restoration, proudly guided the reconstruction of the cabin at the Botanical Garden. It was just the type of early Texas architecture that founders of the Botanical Garden had in mind when they planned to have structures representing Texas’ geographic diversity in the 11-acre Texas Native Trail.
30:Schumacher House:One of Fredericksburg’s earliest settlers, tailor Friedrich Wilhelm Schumacher, built this limestone and fachwerk home in 1849 in Fredericksburg, TX (on Austin Street). Schumacher, born in 1815, was one of the earliest settlers in the area. His first concern on arrival was to build a home for his wife and two young children. The building materials used in the house graphically demonstrate the use of materials close at hand to the first settlers. With each subsequent addition of a room (three rooms total), construction techniques advanced. The first room utilizes post oak beams and a mixture of red clay, grass and woven willow branches from a nearby creek for filler support. Vertical, horizontal and slanting beams were held together with wooden pegs in this fachwerk construction. A second room, elevated one step from the original room is made from post oak beams, rock infill and crude mortar. Sections of wall space in the first two rooms reveal the underlying structure. At the rear of the house, the third room is made from quarried limestone, abundant in the Texas Hill Country. As the architecture evolves, handhewn beams advance later to sawed beams. The simple plantings of an early German homestead complete the setting of the Schumacher House. To reach the Botanical Garden, the structure was disassembled, indexed and re-assembled on site. The restoration of the Schumacher House by the San Antonio Botanical Garden won a 2006 preservation award from the San Antonio Conservation Society.
31:East Texas Log Cabin:Settlers in East Texas, where rainfall is plentiful (up to 58 inches per year), used the abundance of large trees to make their homes. The East Texas Pineywoods are located on the edge of the vast pine-hardwood forest that extends over the Southeastern United States. The size of the pines in East Texas often meant larger log homes than in other parts of the state. This authentic, hand-hewn post oak log cabin from Fayette County, built in the 1850s, sits at the lake’s edge on the Texas Native Trail. The cabin — representative of East Texas pioneer life at the time — is accompanied by the barn, smokehouse and wellhead from its original site in Park, TX (near La Grange). Its deeply shaded wraparound porch provided ample protected space for the daily needs of pioneer life. Inside, the house consists of one room with a fireplace and a high ceiling. Evidence of a loft also remains. With no stores around the corner, pioneer homesteads like this one relied on the nearby kitchen garden to spice up meals of farm-raised pork or fresh game. Women were usually the ones to care for the small kitchen garden that provided fresh vegetables, herbs and fruit for the family, while men tended farm crops of corn, cotton and beans. When moved to the Botanical Garden, all buildings were carefully indexed, dismantled, relocated and reconstructed in an ecologically accurate setting to illustrate the early Texans’ dependence on native vegetation.
32:Bird Watch:Each year millions of birds migrate between wintering grounds in Central and South America and summer nesting sites throughout the U.S. and Canada. Because of its location on these migratory routes, Texas is home to over 600 bird species, more than any other state. And San Antonio is positioned as the gateway to birding in South Texas, where the lower Rio Grande Valley hosts a variety of Mexican birds. With its key position along this Central Flyway of migrating birds, the South Texas region of the Texas Native Trail now features the Bird Watch, perfect for unobtrusive bird watching. Its mirrored glass front gives guests a one-way glimpse of birdlife up close and personal. This one-room observatory, completed in 2010, sits amidst an expanding native plant collection that complements the habitat needs of migrating birds. The flora and shallow water trough have attracted over 200 species of birds, while the bench seating, viewing portholes, and cooling fans overhead attract birders year-round. View the birding check list or the eBird reports for the latest sightings in the Botanical Garden. Fed by a roof cistern collecting rainwater, a shallow trough in front of the Bird Watch beckons its feathered guests with the sound of dripping water. Just deep enough for wading, the birds can take a long cool sip or linger for a refreshing splash. Native plants complement the setting and were careful complied with consideration for the seasons.
